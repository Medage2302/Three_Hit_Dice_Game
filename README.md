# Three_Hit_Dice_Game
This project is a simple command-line game called "Three Hit Dice Game." In this game, two players guess sequences of dice rolls (either "U" for Up if the dice roll is greater than 3 or "D" for Down if it is less than or equal to 3). The first player to match their guess with the sequence of dice rolls wins the game.
